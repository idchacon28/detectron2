Detectron2 is FAIR's next-generation platform for object detection, segmentation and other visual recognition tasks. 

### Environment Installation
It is essential that you have a detectron2 environment:

See [installation instructions](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html).

## Replicating Robust 3D Human Dense Pose Estimation Results
Please run the following command to have a softlink to the best model weights, where your directory is the folder in which you cloned the repository:

```
 ln -s /media/user_home1/idchacon/detectron2/projects/DensePose/exp4_best_model your_directory/detectron2/projects/DensePose
```

You will also need a softlink to the dataset:

```
ln -s /media/user_home1/idchacon/detectron2/datasets your_directory/detectron2/projects/DensePose
```

You will find the *main.py* by running the following command:

```
cd projects/Densepose
```
